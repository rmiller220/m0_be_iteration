# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
Not super confident. I am feeling overwhelmed
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I felt like I was understanidng, but then I constantly feel like I am banging my head agaist the wall
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
i need to practice everything. I am feeling really overwhelmed. I sometimes want to cry. I actually have. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Will this get better? Will I begin to feel more comfortable?
